        <i>Titration: </i>
        <p>The word titration comes from the Latin word "titulus", which means inscription or title. The French word title means rank. Therefore, titration means the determination of concentration or rank of a solution with respect to water with a pH of 7. <br> <br>The standard solution is usually added from a graduated vessel called a burette. The process of adding standard solution until the reaction is just complete is termed as titration and the substance to be determined is said to be titrated. <br><br> All chemical reactions cannot be considered as titrations. A reaction can be serve as a basis of a titration procedure only if the following conditions are satisfied:
        <ul>
            <li>The reaction must be a fast one.</li>
            <li>It must proceed stoichiometrically.</li>
            <li>The change in free energy during the reaction must be sufficiently large for spontaneity of the reaction.</li>
            <li>There should be a way to detect the completion of the reaction.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <br> <br>
        <i>End point and Equivalence point:</i> <br> 
        <p>For a reaction, a stage which shows the completion of a particular reaction is known ans end point. Equivalence point is a stage in which the amount of reagent added is exactly and stoichiometrically equivalent to the amount of the reacting substance in the titrated solution. The end point is detected by some physical change produced by the solution, by itself or more usually by the addition of an auxiliary reagent known as an 'indicator'. The end point and the equivalence point may not be identical. End point is usually detected only after adding a slight excess of the titrant. In many cases, the difference between these two will fall within the experimental error.

         <i>Acid base titration: </i>
         <p>The chemical reaction involved in acid-base titration is known as neutralisation reaction. It involves the combination of H<sup>+</sup> ions to form water. In acid-base titration, solutions of alkali are titrated against standard acid solutions or vice versa. The estimation of an alkali solution using a standard acid solution is called acidimetry. Similarly, the estimation of an acid solution using a standard alkali is called alkalimetry.

         <i>The Theory of Acid-Base Indicators: </i> <br>
         <p>Ostwald developed a theory of acid-base indicators which gives an explanation for the colour change with change in pH. According to this theory, a hydrogen ion indicator is a weak organic aid or bae. The undissociated molecule will have one colour and the ion formed by its dissociation will have a different colour. <br>Let the indicator be a weak organic acid of formulae HIn. It has dissociated into H<sup>+</sup> and In<sup>-</sup>. The unionized molecule has one colour, say colour (1), while the ion, In<sup>-</sup> has a different colour, say colour (2). Since HIn and In have different colours, the actual colour of the indicator will depend upon the hydrogen ion concentration [H <sup>+</sup>]. When the solution is acidic, that is H<sup>+</sup> ions presen in excess, the indicator will show predominantly colour (1). On the other hand, when the solution is alkaline, that is, when OH<sup>-</sup> ions present in excess. the H<sup>+</sup> ions furnished by the indicator will be taken out to form undissociated water. Therefore there will be laregr concentration of the ions, In<sup>-</sup>. Thus the indicator will show predominantly colour (2). <br> <br> Some indicators will be used to determine pH because of their colour changes somewhere along the change in pH range. Some common indicators and their respective colour changes are given below. <br> <br>
